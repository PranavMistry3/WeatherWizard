# WeatherWizard

This project implements a weather prediction machine learning algorithm using the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm in Python. The dataset for training the model was curated from the Wunderground Repository using a RESTful API. The algorithm predicts weather conditions based on historical data and features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Key Features

- Accurate weather prediction using K-NN algorithm.
- Data curated from the Wunderground Repository using a RESTful API.
- Manual data cleaning and preprocessing for improved prediction accuracy.
- Visualization and analysis of the dataset using R.

## Project Overview

### Data Collection

The dataset used for training the model was collected from the Wunderground Repository via a RESTful API. This dataset includes historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

1. **Manual Data Cleaning:** The dataset underwent manual data cleaning to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Selection and Extraction:** Features were selected based on their relevance to weather prediction. This process involved careful analysis and resulted in a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

### Model Implementation

The K-NN algorithm was implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict weather conditions accurately.

### Visualization and Analysis

Before data preprocessing, the dataset was visualized and analyzed using R. This step provided insights into the distribution of data, patterns, and relationships between variables.
